    <p>Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully. 
        We are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock. 
        The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.
        Pancakes are fluffy and delicious. They are a great breakfast food, And they can be topped with anything you like.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Use room temperature ingredients. This will help the batter
             to come together more easily and produce light and fluffy pancakes.</li>
             <li>Don't overmix the batter. Overmixing will develop the gluten in the flour, which will make the pancakes tough.</li>
            <li>Cook the pancakes over medium heat. This will help them to cook evenly without burning.</li>
           <li>Don't overcrowd the skillet. If you add too many pancakes to the skillet at once, they will steam instead of cook.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes when they are bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges are dry.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes immediately with your favorite toppings</li>
        </ol>
